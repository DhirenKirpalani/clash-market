Goal:
Build a gamified, Solana-connected challenge interface where users pay 10 USDC to join a trading competition using their existing Drift account. No in-app trading. Everything is off-platform, with leaderboard tracked via %PnL.

Sections to Build:
1. Lobby (Hero Section)
Purpose: Set the theme, give the countdown, push CTA.

Headline: "Enter the Arena of Alpha"

Subheading: "Stake your skills. Trade to the top. Win the pot."

Countdown Timer: Live, until July 6, 10:00 AM UTC

Mini Stats (live or mocked):

Players Joined: 23

Pool: 230 USDC

Starts: July 6, 10:00 AM UTC

Visual Style: Dark-mode, glowing UI, fantasy/RPG tone

CTA Button: Join the Challenge → scrolls to registration

2. Join Challenge Section
Connect Wallet button (Phantom/Backpack)

Input Username (validate uniqueness)

Select Challenge (only “Weekend Warriors” for now)

Pay Entry Fee: 10 USDC via SPL transfer

On success: emit PlayerRegistered, show success state

Prevent:

Duplicate usernames (per challenge)

Multiple entries from same wallet

Registration after challenge starts

3. Rules & Rewards
Design this as a card-based or timeline visual:

Challenge time: July 6, 10AM–6PM UTC

Allowed markets: SOL-PERP, ETH-PERP, BTC-PERP

Winning Metric: %PnL = ((Equity - 100) / 100) * 100

Disqualifiers:

Liquidation

Trading unauthorized pairs

Margin deposits during challenge

Wallet mismatch

Prize Structure: Winner-take-all or 70/20/10

Platform Fee: 5–10%

Funds: Held in escrow

Use icons (💀, 🏆, 🧠) and animations if possible.

4. Leaderboard
Live or static table:

🏅 Rank	Username	Wallet (Masked)	%PnL	Status
🥇 1	TraderX	0x12...Ae	+42%	🟢
💀	Liquidated status shows with icon			
⚠️	Disqualified = red row			

5. Waitlist / Notify Me

Toast: “You’re on the list!”
